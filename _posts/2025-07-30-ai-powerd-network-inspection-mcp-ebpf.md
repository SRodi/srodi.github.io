## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of network monitoring and observability, I embarked on an exciting project to explore two cutting-edge technologies: **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** for kernel-level network monitoring and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for AI-powered analysis. The result is a powerful duo of tools that demonstrate how modern system programming can be enhanced with artificial intelligence.

## The Vision

The goal was ambitious yet focused: create a system that could monitor network connections at the kernel level using eBPF technology, then leverage AI to provide intelligent insights about network behavior patterns. This would serve as both a learning exercise in these emerging technologies and a practical tool for network analysis.

## Project Architecture: A Tale of Two Servers

The solution consists of two complementary projects that work in harmony:

### 1. eBPF Server: The Data Engine

The [ebpf-server](https://github.com/SRodi/ebpf-server) project serves as the foundation—a high-performance HTTP API server that uses eBPF programs to monitor network connections directly in the Linux kernel.

**Key Features:**
- **Kernel-Level Monitoring**: eBPF programs capture `connect()` syscalls with minimal overhead
- **RESTful API**: Clean HTTP endpoints for easy integration
- **Protocol Intelligence**: Automatic detection of TCP/UDP protocols and port-based service identification
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live connection statistics and metrics
- **Low Overhead**: Efficient kernel-space monitoring with negligible performance impact

**Technical Highlights:**
- Written in Go with C eBPF programs
- Supports both TCP connections and UDP connections that use `connect()`
- Provides detailed connection metadata including timestamps, process information, and destination details
- Includes comprehensive protocol detection and connection classification

### 2. NetSpy: The AI-Powered Client

The [netspy](https://github.com/SRodi/netspy) project is a sophisticated MCP client that consumes data from the eBPF server and enhances it with AI-powered insights.

**Key Features:**
- **MCP Integration**: Self-contained Model Context Protocol server with internal client communication
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration for intelligent network behavior analysis
- **Interactive Interface**: Command-line interface for real-time network exploration
- **Multiple Query Modes**: Support for process names, PIDs, and time-based filtering
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated analysis of connection patterns and anomalies

## The Learning Journey

### Discovering eBPF

eBPF proved to be a fascinating technology that operates at the intersection of system programming and observability. Key learnings included:

- **Kernel Integration**: eBPF programs run safely in kernel space, providing unprecedented visibility into system operations
- **Performance Benefits**: The ability to filter and process data at the kernel level dramatically reduces overhead compared to userspace monitoring
- **Safety Guarantees**: The eBPF verifier ensures programs are safe and cannot crash the kernel

### Exploring the Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol opened up new possibilities for AI integration:

- **Standardized AI Integration**: MCP provides a clean, standardized way to expose tools and resources to AI systems
- **Tool Composition**: The protocol enables building complex AI-powered workflows by combining simple tools
- **Interactive AI**: Real-time conversation with AI about network data creates new possibilities for network analysis

## Technical Deep Dive

### eBPF Server Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   HTTP Client   │───▶│ HTTP API Server │───▶│  eBPF Programs  │
│ (curl, apps,    │    │     (REST)      │    │   (Kernel)      │

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

The eBPF server captures network events through kernel hooks, processes them in userspace, and exposes them via HTTP endpoints:

- `POST /api/connection-summary` - Get connection statistics for specific processes
- `GET/POST /api/list-connections` - List detailed connection events with filtering
- `GET /health` - Service health check

### NetSpy MCP Architecture

                       └─────────────────┘
```

NetSpy implements a complete MCP server that provides four main tools:

1. **get_network_summary** - Statistical overview of connection attempts
2. **list_connections** - Detailed connection listings with filtering
3. **analyze_patterns** - Automated pattern detection and analysis
4. **ai_insights** - AI-powered interpretation of network behavior

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Interactive Network Analysis

```bash
$ ./netspy
🔗 Network Telemetry MCP Server
Starting interactive mode...

netspy-mcp> summary --process curl
Process 'curl' made 5 outbound connection attempts over the last 60 seconds

netspy-mcp> analyze --process curl
Connection Analysis:
  Top destinations:
    172.217.164.78:443 (3 connections)
    8.8.8.8:53 (2 connections)
  Protocols: TCP (3), UDP (2)

netspy-mcp> insights "curl made 5 connections in 60 seconds"
🤖 AI Network Insights:
This connection pattern shows typical web client behavior...
```

### Automated Monitoring

The system enables sophisticated monitoring workflows:

```bash
# Monitor nginx connection patterns
./netspy --tool analyze_patterns --process nginx

# Get AI insights about connection spikes
./netspy --tool ai_insights --summary-text "nginx made 250 connections in 60 seconds"

# List suspicious connection attempts
./netspy --tool list_connections --max-events 1000
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### eBPF Complexity

**Challenge**: eBPF programming requires deep kernel knowledge and careful attention to safety constraints.

**Solution**: Started with simple connection tracking, gradually adding features like protocol detection and timestamp conversion. The Go eBPF ecosystem (particularly cilium/ebpf) provided excellent abstractions.

### MCP Integration

**Challenge**: The Model Context Protocol was relatively new with limited examples for complex integrations.

**Solution**: Implemented a self-contained MCP server within the client application, allowing for rich tool composition while maintaining simplicity.

### AI Context Management

**Challenge**: Providing meaningful network data context to AI models without overwhelming them.

**Solution**: Developed structured data formats and summary representations that give AI models the right level of detail for analysis.

## Performance and Safety

### eBPF Benefits
